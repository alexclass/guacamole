# Apache Guacamole

Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like SSC, Telnet, VNC, and RDP. It is open source and requires no plugins or client software installed. Thanks to HTML5, once Guacamole is installed on a server, all you need to access your remote desktops and servers is a web browser.

Since Guacamole is accessed via your web browser, you can install Guacamole on a Cloud Service Provider (e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, or Google) and access Guacamole through your corporate proxy server. This can enable you to remotely access your Cloud hosted virtual machines without having to configure Firewall Rules or establish a Virtual Private Network.

## Preface

When the need for a "jump server" arose, I deployed the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/guacamole-rdp-vnc-gateway-existing-vnet">Apache Guacamole Azure Quick Start Template</a>. This template was a great introduction to Apache Guacamole. However, it leveraged multiple Docker images, and I wasn't certian what other software resided within these containers. The magic behind this template came from a base64 encoded custom data <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/using-cloud-init">Cloud-Init</a> script, which didn't lend intself to my intention of sharing this template and allowing people to easily specify their desired database password and configuration. Since the skills required to develop ARM templates are required to obtain MCSE: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure certification, and that I needed to deploy Apache Guacamole, the challenge was on to develop an ARM template that could be reused and was configurable.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you up and running with Apache Guacamole in no time at all.

### Prerequisites

In order to deploy this Azure Resource Manager template you will need provide the following parameters.

| Parameter                 | Description  |
| :-------------------------|:-------------|
| **Name**                   | Name of your Apache Guacamole Virtual Machine. |
| **DNS Prefix**             | DNS prefix for the assigned the Public IP address. |
| **Size**                   | Compute instance size (e.g. Standard_A2_v2). |
| **Username**               | Apache Guacamole Virtual Machine Administrator username.|
| **SSH Public Key**         | SSH Public Key that will be used for SSH authentication.|
| **Vnet Name**              | Name of an existing Virtual Network.|
| **Vnet RG**                | Name of the Resource Group where your Virtual Network resides.|
| **Subnet Name**            | Name of an existing Subnet within your Virtual Network.|
| **Mysql Root Pwd**         | MySQL root password.|
 **Guac DB Pwd**            | Guacamole database password.|
| **Cert Email Address**     | Email address to be used with the generation of your Let's Encrypt SSL certificate.|

### Generate your SSH Public Key

The SSH protocol supports many authentication methods. Arguably one of the most important of these is public key authentication for ineractive and automated connections. As such, this Azure Resource Manager template requires the use of SSH public key authentication. In order to generate a Public and Private key, you can use a tool called PuTTYgen (Windows) or ssh-keygen (Linux).

### Create an Azure Virtual Network

Most of you should already have an Azure Virtual Network with multiple subnets. However, if this is not the case, you can follow the references below to create an Azure Virtual Network.

```
Reminder: You will need to remember the Resource Group that your Virtual Network resides within.
```

### Deploy to Azure

Once you have the answers to each of the rerequisites, you are ready to proceed with deploying this Azure Resource Manager template by clicking the **Deploy to Azure** button below.

The following will occur as part of the deployment to Microsoft Azure:
* Creation of a Ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine
* Creation of a Public IP address with your specified DNS prefix
* Creation of a Network Security Group that allows incoming traffic on ports 22, 80, 443.
  * Ports 8080 and 8443 are proxied via the Nginx server to Tomcat thus they are not required to be open.
* Installation of Nginx, Tomcat, MySQL, Guacamole, and a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate

</a>

### Login to Guacamole and change your password

The default username and password is **guacadmin**/**guacadmin**. Make sure that you login and change this.

### Customization

If you would like to customize this template to meet your own specific business requirments, you can do so very simply. 

* Make a copy of the entry point script <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigredthelogger/guacamole/master/install.sh">install.sh</a>.
  * Make your desired changes
  * Upload your new script to a publicly available location (e.g. Github) or your Azure Storage Account
  * Override the **scriptActionUri_entrypoint** parameter with the URL to your customized entry point script.
* Make a copy of the Nginx install script <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigredthelogger/guacamole/master/nginx-install.sh">nginx-install.sh</a>.
  * Make your desired changes
  * Upload your new script to a publicly available location (e.g. Github) or your Azure Storage Account
  * Override the **scriptActionUri_nginx** parameter with the URL to your customized Nginx script.
* Make a copy of the Guacamole install script <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigredthelogger/guacamole/master/guac-install.sh">guac-install.sh</a>.
  * Make your desired changes
  * Upload your new script to a publicly available location (e.g. Github) or your Azure Storage Account
  * Override the **scriptActionUri_guacamole** parameter with the URL to your customized Guacamole install script.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Custom Script Extensions 

Custom Script Extensions download and runs scripts on Azure virtual machines. These are useful for post-deployment configuration, software installation, or any other configuration/management task. You can download scripts from Azure Storage or another accessible internet location, or even provide them to the extension at runtime.
```
Tip: Only a single Custom Script Extension can be assigned to an Azure virtual machine.
Option 1: Create a single script that executes all your desired commands or
Option 2: Create an entry point script (reference install.sh in this project) that executes your individual scripts.
```

### 2. Network Security Groups

Be very careful when you want to apply Network Security Groups to both a Azure virtual machine NIC and the subnet at the same time: NSGs are evaluated independently, and an "allow" rule must exist at both levels, otherwise traffic will not be admitted.

### 3. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates

You can inject a script or other metadata into a Microsoft Azure virtual machine at provision time using a feature called custom data. Custom data needs to be base64-encoded and can contain data such as variables, parameters, scripts, or even cloud-init syntax.

You can use cloud-init to install packages and write files, or to configure users and security on select Linux images (e.g. Ubuntu, CoreOS, and RHEL).
